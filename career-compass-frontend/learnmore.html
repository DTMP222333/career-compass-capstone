    <h2>Why Numerology?</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
        Numerology has been used for centuries to understand patterns in
        personality, motivation, and life direction. For our Career Compass
        project, numerology helps translate your natural strengths into
        career-aligned insights.  
        <br><br>
        Each number represents a specific part of “you”:  
        <P>• <strong>Life Path</strong> → your natural direction (35%)  </P>
        <p>• <strong>Expression</strong> → how you operate & communicate (25%)  </p>
        <p>• <strong>Personality</strong> → how others see you (20%)  </p>
        <p>• <strong>Soul Urge</strong> → your inner motivation (10%)  </p>
        <p>• <strong>Birth Number</strong> → your innate gift (10%)  </p>
        <br>
        Together, these form a complete picture of your traits — allowing the system to suggest careers that match your strengths.
